				<h2>Christopher has already started work on his next film.</h2>
				<p>Puck’s Matt Belloni is reporting that Nolan recently began writing his next film. Obviously, no plot details were revealed. As with all Nolans, it’ll most likely be kept hush-hush until the very end, actors will have to read the script in a quiet room etc.</p>
				<p>The post-’Dark Knight’ phase of Nolan’s filmography has consisted of going back and forth between historical drama and sci-fi — 2014’s “Interstellar,” 2017’s “Dunkirk,” 2020’s “Tenet,” and 2023’s “Oppenheimer.” Notice how there’s a three year gap in between each film. We might not be getting this latest one until 2026.</p>

				<h1>Deadpool & Wolverine Can Finally Make Good On A Scrapped MCU Phase 4 Cameo</h1>
				<p>Marvel Studios may revive one scrapped MCU Phase 4 cameo in the multiversal adventure of 2024's upcoming Deadpool & Wolverine. Shortly after Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Fox was finalized in 2019, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige and Deadpool actor Ryan Reynolds confirmed the Merc with a Mouth would be returning in the MCU proper. Since then, Marvel Studios' Deadpool & Wolverine has been revealed to be an epic tale spanning multiple realities across the MCU's multiverse, including the franchise's main continuity and Fox's X-Men Universe, but even more alternate worlds could be visited in the highly-anticipated Phase 5 project.</p>
